Welcome back!  

Welcome to Part 5 - Eating for Health! Now that we’ve covered [Goal Setting,](https://peterherring.netlify.com/posts/journey-to-optimum-health.-part-1-goal-setting/) [Getting Hydrated](https://peterherring.netlify.com/posts/getting-hydrated/), [Why we should be Hydrated](https://peterherring.netlify.com/posts/journey-to-optimum-health.-part-3.-why-water/), and [Rest and Recovery](https://peterherring.netlify.com/posts/journey-to-optimum-health.-part-4-take-a-load-off/), it’s time we take a look at food!

When it comes to what to eat/when you eat it/how often to eat – it’s a case by case basis, a very personal affair. No matter what some might tell you, there is **NO** one size fits all. 



So you might be asking, what then, is this blog going to be about?
Excellent question! What we’re going to go over is how to make the best choices we can on a broad scale, and why. 



Depending on where you’re starting point is, this might be as simple as exchanging fast food meals for home cooked ones. By eliminating the amount of processed foods that we ingest, and replacing that with good quality foods, we give our bodies the right types of nutrients. By feeding ourselves good nutrients, we enable our body to do a lot of things. There are 3 major changes that the average person will notice straight away!

1. A majority of the aches and pains that we’ve been suffering through daily start to disappear. This happens because our bodies being the ultimate machines that they are, fuelled with the proper nutrients begins to heal us from the inside. 

2. An increase in overall energy! That’s right, no more struggling through the week living for that “glorious” weekend sleep in. With the proper fuel, our bodies run more efficiently and are able to transform the food we eat into longer lasting energy. 

3. An increase in overall productivity! This one is a given when we’ve already managed the first two. I mean, how could you not be more productive when you’re in a lot less pain and you’re nowhere near as tired?

   

   

Alright, so now you might be saying to yourself, great, I don’t eat fast food I’m as healthy as can be! …. Well not exactly. 

There are so many ways that we can continue to improve what we eat. Like getting fresh, grass fed meat from your local butcher, or growing your own veggies. By making these changes we’re keeping processed foods out of our diet, while also increasing the nutritional value of the good foods we are eating! 



In summary, what we eat is a choice. In today's society you won’t find yourself near a fast food restaurant while at risk of starving to death!Make the right choices. Skip a meal rather than eat sh*t. Read the labels of stuff you buy and don’t be afraid to ask your vendors what process their foods go through before reaching you!
