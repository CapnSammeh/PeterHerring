Welcome back! If you've been following along you'll know all about **goal setting and hydration**! If this is your first time and you want to catch up on what we've discussed so far click here to go directly to [Part 1](https://peterherring.netlify.com/posts/journey-to-optimum-health.-part-1-goal-setting/)!

Today is all about rest and recovery - the second most important aspect (coming in behind water) when it comes to training and reaching your healthiest version of you. Even though it is so important, R&R is quite often overlooked as not needed but that couldn't be further from the truth! Being a two pronged aspect, lets break it down into two parts. 



**Part 1 - Rest**. 

Rest is our sleep. It isn't a "rest day" from training (we'll get into that later on). It's well known that as humans we *require* 8 hours of sleep to be fully functional people in society - however, I disagree. When it comes to sleep, like everything else, it is totally personal! There are some people who only function at half speed without 10 hours of sleep and there are people who, if they sleep more than 6 hours a night they're wrecked. You need to find **your** sweet spot!! 

Now that we've debunked that - let's talk about WHY our sleep is super important. 

Q. Did you know that when we sleep our bodies never stop working? 

A. Obviously... But what does our body actually DO while we sleep?



While we sleep our body goes through a lot of repair. The hormonal, muscular and nervous systems are repaired; as well as our organs. Chemicals start to circulate within us that strengthen the immune system. 

When we train, especially at the start, all these systems within the body are under immense stress! One of the best features we have as humans is that we adapt to stress to prolong our lives - imagine if we never had the chance to repair all the damage done to our bodies from stress?

Next, our brain sorts and processes all the information we've absorbed during the day, this is important for creating long term memories as the information is sorted and filed away for later use. 

We need to make sure we have consistency when it comes to sleep. Waking up at different times every morning has been linked to premature aging. Building a night time routine is the most practical way to ensure you get that consistency!

Living in a time when stress is a constant presence in our lives, what things can we do to actively help our bodies through this process? - That's where Recovery comes in.



**Part 2 - Recovery**.

Recovery is a complicated topic. On one hand it's as basic as it sounds - on the other hand it can be a very individualised process and quite in-depth.

Ultimately, recovery comes down to being able to listen to our bodies and understand what it's telling you. For example, if my legs are sore, I need to work through my muscles to figure out what exactly is sore, and once isolated, what kind of sore is it? Is it just muscular soreness from extra use? Is it a sharp, stabbing pain that would indicate something worse? 

Keeping track of how your body feels and reacts to your training is a great way to start understanding it better. Grab a diary or notebook and keep a quick log so you can reflect and pick up on any patterns!

Being able to understand the signals the body sends to the brain is one of the most important skills we can work on as people. 



Once you've got that under control, we can work on assisting the body to repair ourselves from the inside out. 

To start with, **food** is right up there. Consuming the right fuel will provide the body with the nutrients and resources to start repairing (we'll get into food in the upcoming posts). Next is **foam rolling** and **stretching** (static and dynamic). As a guide, I recommend to every person I see that they should be doing a minimum of 20minutes rolling and stretching. The ideal time to do this is right before bed - every single day! Of course once again this is really personalised and if you suffer from chronic aches/pains don't hesitate to reach out for further advice! 

By stretching we relieve the tension that builds in our muscles throughout the course of the day. If you sit/lay down, run through your body in your mind. As you reach each part of the body, attempt to relax that area. Doing this shoud enable you to be able to pinpoint some of the most tense areas you have. Once you know where you're tense - **Stretch**!

Sometimes stretching doesn't really cut it. It might just not be hitting you in right spot or the tenseness is coming from a place that's hard to stretch, ie around the knee joint. 

This is when **foam rolling** comes in handy! By targeting areas around our sore joints/tense muscles we're able to relieve the pressure and therefore, relieve the pain! If it's just tight muscles feel free to get the roller right on it! Avoid rolling over joints though!



Remember, everyone needs to get the appropriate R&R to avoid burnout and other serious illnesses. If you don't do these things already, its time for you to take a load off and start listening to your body!
