Welcome to the first part of my first ever series! If you're unsure that this is for you, fear not because regardless of whether you're a beginner or an advanced trainer, you're either going to learn something new, or jog your memory about something you've been overlooking. 



To start this process, we began before we even think about nutrition or exercising! What we need are goals, and not just any kind of goals. 

But why are goals so important? Because without goals we're just wondering around blindly hoping for the best! You may be thinking "yeah yeah, whatever, goals are easy", but what I'm going to show you is how to set goals that will lead you to success!

The best layout for setting goals is to follow the S.M.A.R.T principle. If you don’t know what this is, it looks like this:
**S**pecific 

**M**easurable

**A**chievable

**R**ealistic

**T**ime frame



Most people will start their journey going “I want to lose weight”, or “I want to build muscle”. Very soon they’ll find themselves unmotivated and struggling to get the training they need, or sticking to their food requirements even though they were so excited to begin with. This is because there’s no way for them to track their progress, keep themselves accountable or to give themselves the little extra push they need to achieve it.
If you want to “lose weight”, cut your leg off and goal achieved! 

That’s why we need to set S.M.A.R.T goals. Following our goal to “lose weight” we would change this to be:

*I want to get rid of 10kg of body fat in 3 months. By changing my eating patterns and exercising 3 times a week.*

**S**pecific - Drop body fat

**M**easurable - 10kg

**A**chievable - this is achievable to do in 3 months for a dedicated person.

**R**ealistic - It takes nothing but determination to change your eating patterns, and exercising 3 times a week is very realistic.

**T**ime frame - 3 months.



Set goals using this method and you’re bound to achieve great things! 
Until next time, 

Pete
