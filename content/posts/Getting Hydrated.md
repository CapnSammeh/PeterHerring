Part 2 is here! If you're new to this series you might want to consider checking out [Part 1](https://peterherring.netlify.com/posts/journey-to-optimum-health.-part-1-goal-setting/)!

Water, water, water! The amount of people I meet who don't know how much water they should be drinking is outstanding! 

There is no magic number of how much water you should be drinking because everyone is different and we all have varying circumstances (we'll get into that later) which change how much we need. 

As a guide, we want to start with a minimum of 0.5 litres per 10kg of body weight. If you weigh 60kg - yep, you need to be drinking at least 3 litres of water PER DAY. 

Now, if you're currently drinking 0 litres of water or anything below the minimum we worked out before slow down. Don't go from drinking F all to drowning yourself in a day! Take it easy, hit a small water goal and maintain it. Say you go from zero to 1 litre, maintain that for a few days and than increase again. Take it 500ml at a time and within weeks you'll be where you should be!



Okay, I mentioned earlier about varying circumstances. If you work inside, in a call environment and don't sweat at all - maintain that minimum amount, you're in the clear! But if you work outside, in the heat all day - you may want to consider doubling that average!

Caffeine is something else that you need to be mindful of when looking to keep yourself hydrated. As it's a diurtic, it will mess with your hydration levels. A rule I use is if you went and bought a Medium flat white at the shops, you should drink an extra litre of water to make sure you stay on top of it. 

Keep an eye out for Part 3 where I'll discuss **WHY** we need to make sure we stay hydrated. 

Get those water totals up and you'll hear from me soon,

Pete.
