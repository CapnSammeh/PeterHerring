Congratulations! You’ve found it. That’s right, this is **the** Blog for stepping up your Health &amp; Fitness regime.

Hi, my names Peter, and this is my story. It starts in 2016, half way through May when I was in the Army. I was young, strong and thought myself invincible - *boy oh boy was I wrong*. 

It came from nothing, this sharp stabbing pain radiating down my leg - (Oh sh*t). It’s fine I told myself, just push through it - No Pain No Gain, you know? Flash forward 3 months from that day and I was the spitting image of Quasimodo from The Hunchback of Notre Dame - I’d broken my back and had severe nerve damage. I could barely move my left leg and my right wasn’t far away either. I had to hunch over to move because straightening would cause excruciating pain.

I was looked after really well, saw Physio’s twice a week and had regular appointments with doctors and specialists.

The only catch? - Nothing we tried made anything better. I had nerve blockers put in, still nothing. After we tried everything I was willing to do (some surgeries just aren’t worth the risk); The Army let me go and I went off to keep searching for a way forward. That’s when I found my
way into the Holistic Approach.

By fixing my approach **life** I was able to fix my back. I went from not being able to put my own shoes on to Dead Lifting like a pro!

Ultimately, it got me thinking, what I can do now to make sure people don’t have to experience years of fruitless activity, appointments, surgeries? I became a full time personal trainer at a gym that specializes in taking on a Holistic approach. But that’s not enough for me, I’m limited to the number of people I’m able to help face-to-face, so here I am, but my knowledge out there - *for you*.

It’s your choice if you want to apply the tips/changes that this blog brings on. I also don’t expect you take everything I say as Gospel - **TRY IT!** Try it for yourself and tell me if it hasn’t worked for you! Everything I know, say and do isn’t something I haven’t done before and it has the ability to change your life for the better.

Let’s get through this process together.

Chat soon!

Pete
