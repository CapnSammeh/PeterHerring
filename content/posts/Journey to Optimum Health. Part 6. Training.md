Welcome back to the series! Today's post is going to be the last one from the series but not the last post so stay tuned! 

The topic I'll be talking about today is, of course, going to be training! 



Some people think that training is the"_bee's knee's_" when it comes to getting fit and healthy. However, training only makes up 20% of the process which is why this post has been left to last. Everything else we've covered are the foundations and before we build on that  by training, we have to those rock solid. 



When we start training it doesn't matter if it's at home, at a park or in the gym, the major focus is to work on OUR WHOLE BODY. That's right. Every single workout is going to comprise of Legs, Chest, Back and Core. On top of this, as you are only starting out it's super important that we use our rest periods to roll and stretch. The reason for this is to help speed up recovery and prevent injury, caused by the increase in load put on your body. 



You should seek out professional help when starting out. There are so many random, blanket workouts floating around on the internet/social media that it is **SUPER** important to make sure what you're doing is going to aggravate anything and that you're performing the exercises correctly to not cause any injuries. 

Just like food, what you do during training is a very personal matter. Everything discussed above does not take into consideration any individual circumstances.
