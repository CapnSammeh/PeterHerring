Water, water, water! The most important thing to human survival. We've talked about how much water we should be drinking, and hopefully you're all hitting your goals or moving towards them!



**But why?** 



For basic human function water is crucial for maintaining the function of every system in our bodies, including our heart, brain and muscles to name a few. Fluids in our body carry nutrients to our cells, flush bacteria and help out our digestive system. Being hydrated will also help us reduce the amount of inflammation that our bodies hold. 

While you're training, you put your body under enormous amounts of stress. We stress our bodies systems, muscular, nervous, immune to name a few. When these systems are under stress our body is susceptible to numerous diseases and harmful bacterias. By making sure we stay hydrated we're adding an extra layer of defence against these diseases/bacteria to help out those systems.



So the question becomes, why wouldn't you want to stay hydrated?



A lot of you may be thinking that the amount of water you're supposed to be drinking is an insane amount and there is no way you could do it because you'd constantly be having to go to the toilet. 

I don't think that that is such a bad thing. For example, if you work behind a desk all day, sitting in an unnatural position, staring at a screen, a break every hour to go to the toilet, stretch, walk around the office is **so** important. By taking this break you enable yourself to be able to maintain 120% focus on your work activities; which will lead to increase in productivity and quality of the work you're doing. 

A way to help our bodies absorb the water that we drink so that you only go every hour rather than every 10 minutes is to add a **sprinkle** of good quality, pink himalayan salt. ONLY A SPRINKLE. You don't want your water to taste like you've filled it up out of the ocean.

Not only will adding salt help your body absorb the water, the amount of nutrients found within good quality pink himalyan salt will do the same job as taking multivitamins but in a much more cost effective way.



Why wouldn't you get, and stay, hydrated? There's no reason to dehydrate yourself unless you're looking to live a terrible, sore, sick and unproductive life.
